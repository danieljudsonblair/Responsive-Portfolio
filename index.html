                <p>One day I eclipsed the eclipse.  Does that make me an astronomer?  An astrophysicist?  An astrologer?  Because I have a fortune for you.</p>
                <p> My experience could be described as disjointed.  I (sort of) adopted a rooster and blogged about it during the MySpace era.  I ponder reactionless propulsion on a regular basis. I have prepared and cooked over 1 million pizzas. I love playing music, as in guitar, drums, and bass.  I have been trying for 15+ years to create a consistently profitable automated futures trading algorithm.  I enjoy moderate to strong turbulence on airplanes; that is, until everyone else starts throwing up :/</p>
                <p id="center"> I feel like I just want what most other people want in life: to find their place and thrive.</p>
